### Architectural Changes

*   **Foreground Service (`AudioWorkerService.java`)**:
    *   Created a new foreground service to own and manage all audio controllers (`MainController`, `RecordController`, etc.).
    *   This moves the core audio logic out of the UI (`MainActivity`) and into a background-safe component, allowing audio functions to continue running when the app is not in the foreground.
    *   Implemented the `onTaskRemoved` method to ensure that if the user swipes the app away, all audio functions are cleanly terminated.

*   **Asynchronous Initialization (`MainActivity` & Fragments)**:
    *   Refactored `MainActivity` to bind to the `AudioWorkerService` asynchronously.
    *   Fixed a race condition where fragments would crash on startup by creating a `ControllerReadyListener` interface.
    *   Fragments now wait for this signal before initializing their UI, ensuring the `MainController` is always available when needed.
    *   To prevent a blank screen during this brief initialization, the fragments' main content is now hidden by default and only made visible after the controller is ready and the UI has been populated.

### UI & Lifecycle Fixes

*   **`AndroidManifest.xml`**:
    *   Added the necessary `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` permissions.
    *   Declared the `AudioWorkerService` and specified its `foregroundServiceType` as "microphone" to comply with modern Android requirements.

*   **Fragment Refactoring (`WorkerFragment`, `AudioRxSupportFragment`, etc.)**:
    *   Introduced an abstract `getContainerView()` method in the base `WorkerFragment` to create a robust contract for subclasses.
    *   All concrete fragments now implement this method to provide a reference to their main content container, which is used to manage visibility during startup.

### Code Health & Best Practices

*   **Dynamic Version Display (`MainActivity.java` & `strings.xml`)**:
    *   The app's title no longer uses a hardcoded version number.
    *   It now dynamically reads the `versionName` from the APK at runtime, parses it to show only the desired part (e.g., "v1.6.2"), and displays it in the title bar.
    *   Updated the code to use the modern, non-deprecated `getPackageInfo` method.

*   **Code Cleanup**:
    *   Added `stopAll...()` methods to each controller to provide a single point for shutting down all audio tasks.
    *   The `destroy()` methods in the controllers now call these new functions for a cleaner shutdown sequence.
    *   Added comments to acknowledge and explain the intentional use of a deprecated method in `MainActivity` for future reference.
